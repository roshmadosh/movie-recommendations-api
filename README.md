# Microservice API for a Machine Learning Model that Gives Movie Recommendations
---
Train data obtained using [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) API.  

Data can be regenerated by calling the `app_scripts/fetch.py` and `app_scripts/parquet.py` files in succession. The first create CSV's containing the data used for the model. The latter converts those CSV's to parquet files.  

Note that you must manually delete the CSV and parquet files in `app_data/` before calling these scripts.

Recommendation model created using `scikit-learn`'s `TfidfVectorizer` to tokenize movie title and summary, then combining the cosine similarities of the tokens and the genre categories to produce a single, pairwise similarity score.
